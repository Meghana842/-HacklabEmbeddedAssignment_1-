 What is the input range of this DC/DC Converter?
-53v to  700v

Is it an isolated or non-isolated converter?
Isolation in terms of DC/DC converters refers to galvanic isolation which means that there is no 
metallic / direct conduction path between two parts of the circuit. The isolation will always present 
a barrier between the input stage and the output stage and may be required for circuit functionality,
 safety, or both.
Isolated converters: In an isolated converter, the input and output stage have separate grounds whereas in a non-isolated 
converter, current is able to flow directly between the two sides as they share a common ground.
non isolated converter: The primary difference is that a non-isolated converter does not have a transformer and does not require any physical 
separation between input and output, so this typically makes them smaller and lighter. It also improves
 the efficiency as there are no transformer losses to take into consideration.

 What is the wattage of the converter?
 A wattage converter is an electric device using the electromagnetic principle to change the voltage from the primary side to the secondary side. Their purpose like a transformer.
